      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Cue the Mona-Lisa Saperstein voice: Money, _please!_

Hello! My name is Brooke! I am 24 years old working in the corporate world. I work a customer service job in finance which means I can handle myself on a date with a Tinder Finance Bro but they make more than me. Let's hear it for equality!

This brings me to the main reason of this blog - no wait, this *movement!* - I want to spill the beans and the tea and whatever else Gen Z is saying these days on MONEY. Say it louder for the people in the back: **M O N E Y**. It's what makes the world go round. It's what gets you up in the morning. It's what makes your dad say "Honey sit down, we need to talk about your credit card statement". Zoinks Shaggy, it looks like we spent too much money.

Anyway, enough with the blabber. Let's get to the juicy stuff. Money, _please!_ is a blog where I tell you what I spend my money on. I will share my thoughts, my hopes, my dreams, and credit card statement. This is an inspiration from Refinery29's Money Diaries series which is the only thing that gets me out of bed each morning.</p>
