5:45am: My alarm goes off. I am supposed to get up and workout on my stationary bike in my garage, but I noticed my phone is low on battery. It didn’t charge all night because the charger wasn’t plugged in. I plug it back, scroll on social media, check my bank accounts, and decide to go back to sleep.

7:00am: My second alarm goes off. I turn on my lamp which wakes my 11 year old chihuahua up. I will call him Old Man in these posts. Old Man sleeps on a pillow next to my bed and he is so dang cute! He grunts and curls back up. I get up, take my dog outside, and then feed him.

7:30am: I log in for work and drink my coffee. I am starting to like coffee, but I don’t want to rely on it. It warms me up and I start working. Work is slow, so I go on YouTube and start my to-do list for the day. I work in customer service for a brokerage firm, so I have to sit at my desk all day long. I don’t love that about my job.

10:45am: I am getting hungry. I already ate Chipotle and Freddy’s hamburgers this week, so I know I need to make something at home. Work is still slow and Old man is in a deep sleep next to me in his bed.

11:30am: I took my lunch break early because I didn’t eat breakfast. Waking up late and not eating breakfast is a bad habit I have, and I am trying to change it. I made a salad with bell peppers, spinach and romaine lettuce, shredded carrots, feta cheese, roasted pumpkin seed, croutons, flax seeds, and some light ranch dressing. I eat my salad while watching Big Little Lies on HBO Max.

12:15pm: Work is picking up, but I still have time to check on my budget. My internet and vision are due today. My vision insurance is $7.58 and my internet is $61.89. $69.47

2:00pm: I took my break from work to do my dishes and laundry. I like having my apartment clean and tidy, which is why I pay for a cleaning service. The mental space and effort I put into cleaning my apartment is so large that I needed to offload that onto someone else. I don’t have to stress out about things not being clean every night because I know someone else will deep clean everything.

4:00pm: I got off of work and laid in bed for a while. I took Old Man out and fed him dinner. Then, I laid in bed for a while. Sometimes I feel so exhausted after work. I think exercising more would help this, but sometimes I am too tired to start. I went to Kroger to get pizza rolls, toilet paper, and dessert for $25.79. J picked up Chick Fil A on the way home from a busy day for $10.00. **$35.79**

7:00pm: I start my two hour overtime shift. I like the overtime money, but I don’t like working late all the time. I am trying to find a good balance between the money and the overtime. It would be nice to have a weeknight to myself. J and I have a lot of expenses in the next few months, so I feel like I need to work as much as possible to prepare.

9:00pm: I get off of work (again) and walk Old Man. I call J and he is walking our other dog, Big Guy. Since I live in a small one bedroom apartment, J keeps Big Guy at a rental house while he is training for work. Big Guy is a black lab-german shorthair pointer mix so he likes to have lots of room to run. My apartment does not have that for him.

10:00pm: I tried to go to bed early tonight, but I didn’t actually put my phone away and fall asleep until about 11:00pm. I walked Old Man and tidied my apartment before going to bed. I am trying to build better habits and cleaning before I go to bed is one of them.

**Total: $105.26**
